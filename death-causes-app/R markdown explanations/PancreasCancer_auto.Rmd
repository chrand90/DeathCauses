Pancreas cancer is a **death cause**. It means that there is a certain probability that one dies from this.

#### Alternative names:
* Pancreas ca.
* Pancreas cancer
* PancreasCancer

#### Categories

Pancreas cancer is part of the following death cause categories

* [Cancer](/model/Cancer)

#### Risk factors

In the model Pancreas cancer has the following [risk factors](/model/intro#risk-factor)

* [Coffee consumption](/model/Caffeine) (Coffee)
* [Diabetes diagnosis](/model/DiabetesStatus) (Diabetes)

#### Number of deaths

In 2014 Pancreas cancer was responsible for 1.54% of the deaths in the US. Below is a plot of how prevalent the death was for different ages [@CDCreport]
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::load_all('../../Reportgeneration/DatabaseVisualization/RRtablePlotting')
dat=initialize_database(c("../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Causes.json"),
"../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Descriptions.json")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'PancreasCancer')
```


#### Definition

The definition of dying from Pancreas cancer is to get any of the following ICD codes as the main cause of death on one's death certificate. The percentage is the proportion of the deaths from Pancreas cancer who falls under the ICD code 

* <details><summary> C25: Malignant neoplasm of pancreas (100.0%)</summary>
    * C250: Malignant neoplasm of head of pancreas (0.24%)
    * C251: Malignant neoplasm of body of pancreas (0.022%)
    * C252: Malignant neoplasm of tail of pancreas (0.037%)
    * C253: Malignant neoplasm of pancreatic duct (0.16%)
    * C254: Malignant neoplasm of endocrine pancreas (0.099%)
    * C257: Malignant neoplasm of other parts of pancreas (0.0025%)
    * C258: Malignant neoplasm of overlapping sites of pancreas (0.03%)
    * **C259: Malignant neoplasm of pancreas, unspecified (99.0%)**
</details>

#### Interaction

The combined risk ratio of all risk factors is computed using the formula

$$
RR=RR_{\text{Coffee}} \cdot RR_{\text{Diabetes}}
$$

The normalization factor is based on the joint distribution of all the risk factors and is computed using the formula

$$
P=P_{\text{Coffee}} \cdot P_{\text{Diabetes}}
$$


#### Coffee consumption

Coffee consumption is a risk factor for Pancreas cancer.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature alterated to fit our model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'PancreasCancer', c('Caffeine'),'raw')
```


Because the variable Coffee consumption is numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing).
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'PancreasCancer', c('Caffeine'),'interpolated')
```


#### Diabetes diagnosis

Diabetes diagnosis is a risk factor for Pancreas cancer.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature alterated to fit our model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'PancreasCancer', c('DiabetesStatus'),'raw')
```
