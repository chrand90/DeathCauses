Prostate cancer is a **death cause**. It means that there is a certain probability that one dies from this.

#### Alternative names:
* Prostate ca.
* Prostate cancer
* ProstateCancer

#### Categories

Prostate cancer is part of the following death cause categories

* [Cancer](/model/Cancer)

#### Risk factors

In the model Prostate cancer has the following [risk factors](/model/intro#risk-factor)

* [Biological sex](/model/Sex) (Sex)

#### Number of deaths

In 2014 Prostate cancer was responsible for 1.08% of the deaths in the US. Below is a plot of how prevalent the death was for different ages [@CDCreport]
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::load_all('../../Reportgeneration/DatabaseVisualization/RRtablePlotting')
dat=initialize_database(c("../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Causes.json"),
"../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Descriptions.json")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'ProstateCancer')
```


#### Definition

The definition of dying from Prostate cancer is to get any of the following ICD codes as the main cause of death on one's death certificate. The percentage is the proportion of the deaths from Prostate cancer who falls under the ICD code 

* C61: Malignant neoplasm of prostate (100.0%)

 Source: @CDCreport, @ICDcodes



#### Interaction

The combined risk ratio of all risk factors is computed using the formula

$$
RR=RR_{\text{Sex}}
$$

The normalization factor is based on the joint distribution of all the risk factors and is computed using the formula

$$
P=P_{\text{Sex}}
$$


#### Biological sex

Biological sex is a risk factor for Prostate cancer.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature alterated to fit our model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'ProstateCancer', c('Sex'),'raw')
```
