Chronic liver disease is a **death cause**. It means that there is a certain probability that one dies from this.

#### Alternative names:
* Liver dis.
* Liver disease
* Chronic liver disease
* Chronic_Liver_Disease

#### Categories

Chronic liver disease is part of the following death cause categories

* [Non-violent death](/model/NonViolentDeath)

#### Risk factors

In the model Chronic liver disease has the following [risk factors](/model/intro#risk-factor)

* [BMI](/model/BMI)
* [HCV diagnosis](/model/HCVStatus) (HCV)
* [Alcohol consumption](/model/Drinking) (Alcohol)

#### Number of deaths

In 2014 Chronic liver disease was responsible for 1.45% of the deaths in the US. Below is a plot of how prevalent the death was for different ages [@CDCreport]
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::load_all('../../../Reportgeneration/DatabaseVisualization/RRtablePlotting')
dat=initialize_database(c("../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Causes.json"),
"../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Descriptions.json")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'Chronic_Liver_Disease')
```


#### Definition

The definition of dying from Chronic liver disease is to get any of the following ICD codes as the main cause of death on one's death certificate. The percentage is the proportion of the deaths from Chronic liver disease who falls under the ICD code 

* <details><summary> K70: Alcoholic liver disease (51.0%)</summary>
    * K700: Alcoholic fatty liver (0.99%)
    * K701: Alcoholic hepatitis (3.1%)
    * K702: Alcoholic fibrosis and sclerosis of liver (0.0052%)
    * **K703: Alcoholic cirrhosis of liver (36.0%)**
    * K704: Alcoholic hepatic failure (3.6%)
    * K709: Alcoholic liver disease, unspecified (6.8%)
</details>
* <details><summary> K73: Chronic hepatitis, not elsewhere classified (0.16%)</summary>
    * K732: Chronic active hepatitis, not elsewhere classified (0.0052%)
    * K739: Chronic hepatitis, unspecified (0.16%)
</details>
* <details><summary> K74: Fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver (49.0%)</summary>
    * K740: Hepatic fibrosis (0.029%)
    * K741: Hepatic sclerosis (0.021%)
    * K743: Primary biliary cirrhosis (1.0%)
    * K744: Secondary biliary cirrhosis (0.01%)
    * K745: Biliary cirrhosis, unspecified (0.23%)
    * **K746: Other and unspecified cirrhosis of liver (48.0%)**
</details>

#### Interaction

The combined risk ratio of all risk factors is computed using the formula

$$
RR=RR_{\text{BMI}} \cdot RR_{\text{Alcohol,HCV}}
$$

The normalization factor is based on the joint distribution of all the risk factors and is computed using the formula

$$
P=P_{\text{BMI}} \cdot P_{\text{HCV,Alcohol}}
$$


#### BMI

BMI is a risk factor for Chronic liver disease.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature alterated to fit our model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'Chronic_Liver_Disease', c('BMI'),'raw')
```


Because the variable BMI is numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing).
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'Chronic_Liver_Disease', c('BMI'),'interpolated')
```


#### Alcohol consumption, HCV diagnosis

Alcohol consumption and HCV diagnosis are a group of risk factors for Chronic liver disease.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature alterated to fit our model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'Chronic_Liver_Disease', c('Drinking','HCVStatus'),'raw')
```


Because the variable Alcohol consumption is numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing)for every value of the other variables.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'Chronic_Liver_Disease', c('Drinking','HCVStatus'),'interpolated')
```
