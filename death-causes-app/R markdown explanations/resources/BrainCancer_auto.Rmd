Brain cancer is a **death cause**. It means that there is a certain probability that one dies from this.

#### Alternative names:
* Brain cancer
* BrainCancer

#### Categories

Brain cancer is part of the following death cause categories

* [Cancer](/model/Cancer)

#### Risk factors

In the model Brain cancer has the following [risk factors](/model/intro#risk-factor)

* [Head traumas](/model/HeadTrauma)

#### Number of deaths

In 2014 Brain cancer was responsible for 0.609% of the deaths in the US. Below is a plot of how prevalent the death was for different ages [@CDCreport]
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::load_all('../../../Reportgeneration/DatabaseVisualization/RRtablePlotting')
dat=initialize_database(c("../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Causes.json"),
"../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Descriptions.json")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'BrainCancer')
```


#### Definition

The definition of dying from Brain cancer is to get any of the following ICD codes as the main cause of death on one's death certificate. The percentage is the proportion of the deaths from Brain cancer who falls under the ICD code

    * C700: Malignant neoplasm of cerebral meninges (0.21%)
    * C709: Malignant neoplasm of meninges, unspecified (0.65%)

#### Interaction

The combined risk ratio of all risk factors is computed using the [formula](/model/intro#interaction-formulas)

$$
RR=RR_{\text{Head traumas}}
$$

The normalization factor is based on the joint distribution of all the risk factors and is computed using the [formula](/model/intro#interaction-formulas)

$$
P=P_{\text{Head traumas}}
$$


#### Head traumas

Head traumas is a risk factor for Brain cancer.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature adjusted to fit the model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'BrainCancer', c('HeadTrauma'),'raw')
```


Because the variable Head traumas is numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing).

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'BrainCancer', c('HeadTrauma'),'interpolated')
```
