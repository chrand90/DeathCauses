Bladder cancer is a **death cause**. It means that there is a certain probability that one dies from this.

#### Alternative names:
* Bladder ca.
* Bladder cancer
* BladderCancer

#### Categories

Bladder cancer is part of the following death cause categories

* [Cancer](/model/Cancer)

#### Risk factors

In the model Bladder cancer has the following [risk factors](/model/intro#risk-factor)

* [Fluids intake](/model/Fluids) (Fluids)
* [Time since smoking per year](/model/SmokeSinceStop) (Smoke end a.)
* [Cumulative smoke duration](/model/SmokeDurationCumulative) (Smoke dur. a)
* [Smoking average](/model/SmokeTypicalAmount) (Smoke avg.)

#### Number of deaths

In 2014 Bladder cancer was responsible for 0.6% of the deaths in the US. Below is a plot of how prevalent the death was for different ages [@CDCreport]
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::load_all('../../../Reportgeneration/DatabaseVisualization/RRtablePlotting')
dat=initialize_database(c("../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Causes.json"),
"../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Descriptions.json")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'BladderCancer')
```


#### Definition

The definition of dying from Bladder cancer is to get any of the following ICD codes as the main cause of death on one's death certificate. The percentage is the proportion of the deaths from Bladder cancer who falls under the ICD code 

* <details><summary> C67: Malignant neoplasm of bladder (100.0%)</summary>
    * C670: Malignant neoplasm of trigone of bladder (0.013%)
    * C671: Malignant neoplasm of dome of bladder (0.0063%)
    * C674: Malignant neoplasm of posterior wall of bladder (0.0063%)
    * C675: Malignant neoplasm of bladder neck (0.032%)
    * C677: Malignant neoplasm of urachus (0.2%)
    * **C679: Malignant neoplasm of bladder, unspecified (99.75%)**
</details>

#### Interaction

The combined risk ratio of all risk factors is computed using the [formula](/model/intro#interaction-formulas)

$$
RR=RR_{\text{Fluids}} \cdot RR_{\text{Smoke dur. a,Smoke end a.}} \cdot RR_{\text{Smoke avg.}}
$$

The normalization factor is based on the joint distribution of all the risk factors and is computed using the [formula](/model/intro#interaction-formulas)

$$
P=P_{\text{Fluids}} \cdot P_{\text{Smoke end a.,Smoke dur. a,Smoke avg.}}
$$


#### Fluids intake

[Fluids intake](/model/Fluids) is a risk factor for Bladder cancer.

Higher fluid intake decreases the risk of bladder cancer. We use the numbers from @michaud1999fluid who found a significant dose-response relationship. Interestingly, when the analysis was conducted separately for each type of fluid, only water was significant. However, we will not use this fact, because the other beverages may be equally beneficial, which would also make sense if the authors' argumentation,  "fluid intake is good because it increases urination and thereby bladder cancer risk", is correct.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'BladderCancer', c('Fluids'),'raw')
```


Because the variable Fluids intake is numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing).

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'BladderCancer', c('Fluids'),'interpolated')
```


#### Cumulative smoke duration, Time since smoking per year

Cumulative smoke duration and Time since smoking per year are a group of risk factors for Bladder cancer.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature (possibly adjusted to fit the model)

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'BladderCancer', c('SmokeDurationCumulative','SmokeSinceStop'),'raw')
```


Because the variables Cumulative smoke duration and Time since smoking per year are numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing).

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'BladderCancer', c('SmokeDurationCumulative','SmokeSinceStop'),'interpolated')
```


#### Smoking average

[Smoking average](/model/SmokeTypicalAmount) is a risk factor for Bladder cancer.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature (possibly adjusted to fit the model)

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'BladderCancer', c('SmokeTypicalAmount'),'raw')
```


Because the variable Smoking average is numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing).

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'BladderCancer', c('SmokeTypicalAmount'),'interpolated')
```
