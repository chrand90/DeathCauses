Bladder cancer is a **death cause**. It means that there is a certain probability that one dies from this.

#### Alternative names:
* Bladder ca.
* Bladder cancer
* BladderCancer

#### Categories

Bladder cancer is part of the following death cause categories

* [Cancer](/model/Cancer)

#### Risk factors

In the model Bladder cancer has the following [risk factors](/model/intro#risk-factor)

* [Fluids intake](/model/Fluids) (Fluids)
* [Total amount smoked in life](/model/SmokeCumulative) (Smoke total)

#### Number of deaths

In 2014 Bladder cancer was responsible for 0.6% of the deaths in the US. Below is a plot of how prevalent the death was for different ages [@CDCreport]
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::load_all('../../../Reportgeneration/DatabaseVisualization/RRtablePlotting')
dat=initialize_database(c("../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Causes.json"),
"../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Descriptions.json")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'BladderCancer')
```


#### Definition

The definition of dying from Bladder cancer is to get any of the following ICD codes as the main cause of death on one's death certificate. The percentage is the proportion of the deaths from Bladder cancer who falls under the ICD code 

* <details><summary> C67: Malignant neoplasm of bladder (100.0%)</summary>
    * C670: Malignant neoplasm of trigone of bladder (0.013%)
    * C671: Malignant neoplasm of dome of bladder (0.0063%)
    * C674: Malignant neoplasm of posterior wall of bladder (0.0063%)
    * C675: Malignant neoplasm of bladder neck (0.032%)
    * C677: Malignant neoplasm of urachus (0.2%)
    * **C679: Malignant neoplasm of bladder, unspecified (100.0%)**
</details>

#### Interaction

The combined risk ratio of all risk factors is computed using the formula

$$
RR=RR_{\text{Fluids}} \cdot RR_{\text{Smoke total}}
$$

The normalization factor is based on the joint distribution of all the risk factors and is computed using the formula

$$
P=P_{\text{Fluids}} \cdot P_{\text{Smoke total}}
$$


#### Fluids intake

Fluids intake is a risk factor for Bladder cancer.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature alterated to fit our model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'BladderCancer', c('Fluids'),'raw')
```


Because the variable Fluids intake is numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing).
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'BladderCancer', c('Fluids'),'interpolated')
```


#### Total amount smoked in life

Total amount smoked in life is a risk factor for Bladder cancer.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature alterated to fit our model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'BladderCancer', c('SmokeCumulative'),'raw')
```


Because the variable Total amount smoked in life is numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing).
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'BladderCancer', c('SmokeCumulative'),'interpolated')
```
