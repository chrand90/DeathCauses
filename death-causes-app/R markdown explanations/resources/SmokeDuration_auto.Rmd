Time span of smoking period is a **input factor**. It means that it is one of the inputs from the user to the model.

#### Alternative names:
* Smoking dur.
* Smoking time span
* Time span of smoking period
* SmokeDuration

#### Uses

Time span of smoking period is used by the model in the following places

* to compute [Cumulative smoke duration](/model/SmokeDurationCumulative)
* to compute [Total amount smoked in life](/model/SmokeCumulative)
* to compute [Smoking average](/model/SmokeTypicalAmount)

#### Guidance

The user input is a typed number and should answer the question

> For how long have you smoked tobacco?

The unit of the input is **Years**, but can be changed to any of the units below

* Months (1 Years = 12.0 Months)
* Days (1 Years = 365.25 Days)

The answer has to be larger than 0 Years.The answer is recommended to be larger than 0 Years and smaller than 110 Years, because that is where the model is most accurate.
