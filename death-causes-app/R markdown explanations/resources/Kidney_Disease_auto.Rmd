Kidney disease is a **death cause**. It means that there is a certain probability that one dies from this.

#### Alternative names:
* Kidney dis.
* Kidney disease
* Kidney_Disease

#### Categories

Kidney disease is part of the following death cause categories

* [Non-violent death](/model/NonViolentDeath)

#### Risk factors

Kidney disease has no [risk factors](/model/intro#risk-factor) in the model (yet).

#### Number of deaths

In 2014 Kidney disease was responsible for 1.86% of the deaths in the US. Below is a plot of how prevalent the death was for different ages [@CDCreport]

#### Definition

The definition of dying from Kidney disease is to get any of the following ICD codes as the main cause of death on one's death certificate. The percentage is the proportion of the deaths from Kidney disease who falls under the ICD code
