BMI is a **input factor**. It means that it is one of the inputs from the user to the model.

#### Uses

BMI is used by the model in the following places

* as a risk factor for [Kidney cancer](/model/KidneyCancer)
* as a risk factor for [Liver cancer](/model/LiverCancer)
* as a risk factor for [Uterus cancer](/model/UterusCancer)
* as a risk factor for [Chronic liver disease](/model/Chronic_Liver_Disease)
* as a risk factor for [Diabetes condition](/model/DiabetesCondition)

#### Guidance

The user input is a typed number and should answer the question

> What is your BMI?

The unit of the input is **kg/m^2**.

The answer has to be larger than 0 kg/m^2.The answer is recommended to be larger than 18 kg/m^2 and smaller than 40 kg/m^2, because that is where the model is most accurate.BMI is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. You can compute it on the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/english_bmi_calculator/bmi_calculator.html).
 A healthy BMI is between 18.5 and 25.
