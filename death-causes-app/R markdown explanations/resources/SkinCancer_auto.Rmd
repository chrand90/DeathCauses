Skin cancer is a **death cause**. It means that there is a certain probability that one dies from this.

#### Alternative names:
* Skin cancer
* SkinCancer

#### Categories

Skin cancer is part of the following death cause categories

* [Cancer](/model/Cancer)

#### Risk factors

In the model Skin cancer has the following [risk factors](/model/intro#risk-factor)

* [Time spent indoor tanning](/model/IndoorTanning) (Sunbed time)
* [Race](/model/Race)

#### Number of deaths

In 2014 Skin cancer was responsible for 0.355% of the deaths in the US. Below is a plot of how prevalent the death was for different ages [@CDCreport]
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::load_all('../../../Reportgeneration/DatabaseVisualization/RRtablePlotting')
dat=initialize_database(c("../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Causes.json"),
"../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Descriptions.json")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'SkinCancer')
```


#### Definition

The definition of dying from Skin cancer is to get any of the following ICD codes as the main cause of death on one's death certificate. The percentage is the proportion of the deaths from Skin cancer who falls under the ICD code 

* <details><summary> C43: Malignant melanoma of skin (100.0%)</summary>
    * C430: Malignant melanoma of lip (0.043%)
    * C431: Malignant melanoma of eyelid, including canthus (0.021%)
    * C432: Malignant melanoma of ear and external auricular canal (0.42%)
    * C433: Malignant melanoma of other and unspecified parts of face (0.86%)
    * C434: Malignant melanoma of scalp and neck (1.8%)
    * C435: Malignant melanoma of trunk (2.4%)
    * C436: Malignant melanoma of upper limb, including shoulder (1.4%)
    * C437: Malignant melanoma of lower limb, including hip (1.6%)
    * **C439: Malignant melanoma of skin, unspecified (91.4%)**
</details>

#### Interaction

The combined risk ratio of all risk factors is computed using the formula

$$
RR=RR_{\text{Sunbed time}} \cdot RR_{\text{Race}}
$$

The normalization factor is based on the joint distribution of all the risk factors and is computed using the formula

$$
P=P_{\text{Sunbed time}} \cdot P_{\text{Race}}
$$


#### Time spent indoor tanning

Time spent indoor tanning is a risk factor for Skin cancer.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature alterated to fit our model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'SkinCancer', c('IndoorTanning'),'raw')
```


Because the variable Time spent indoor tanning is numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing).
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'SkinCancer', c('IndoorTanning'),'interpolated')
```


#### Race

Race is a risk factor for Skin cancer.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature alterated to fit our model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'SkinCancer', c('Race'),'raw')
```
