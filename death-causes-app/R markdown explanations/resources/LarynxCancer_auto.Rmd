Larynx Cancer is a **death cause**. It means that there is a certain probability that one dies from this.

#### Alternative names:
* Larynx ca.
* Larynx Cancer
* LarynxCancer

#### Categories

Larynx Cancer is part of the following death cause categories

* [Cancer](/model/Cancer)

#### Risk factors

In the model Larynx Cancer has the following [risk factors](/model/intro#risk-factor)

* [Alcohol consumption](/model/Drinking) (Alcohol)

#### Number of deaths

In 2014 Larynx Cancer was responsible for 0.143% of the deaths in the US. Below is a plot of how prevalent the death was for different ages [@CDCreport]
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::load_all('../../../Reportgeneration/DatabaseVisualization/RRtablePlotting')
dat=initialize_database(c("../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Causes.json"),
"../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Descriptions.json")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'LarynxCancer')
```


#### Definition

The definition of dying from Larynx Cancer is to get any of the following ICD codes as the main cause of death on one's death certificate. The percentage is the proportion of the deaths from Larynx Cancer who falls under the ICD code 

* <details><summary> C32: Malignant neoplasm of larynx (100.0%)</summary>
    * C320: Malignant neoplasm of glottis (3.8%)
    * C321: Malignant neoplasm of supraglottis (7.2%)
    * C322: Malignant neoplasm of subglottis (0.61%)
    * C323: Malignant neoplasm of laryngeal cartilage (0.08%)
    * **C329: Malignant neoplasm of larynx, unspecified (88.0%)**
</details>

#### Interaction

The combined risk ratio of all risk factors is computed using the formula

$$
RR=RR_{\text{Alcohol}}
$$

The normalization factor is based on the joint distribution of all the risk factors and is computed using the formula

$$
P=P_{\text{Alcohol}}
$$


#### Alcohol consumption

Alcohol consumption is a risk factor for Larynx Cancer.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature alterated to fit our model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'LarynxCancer', c('Drinking'),'raw')
```


Because the variable Alcohol consumption is numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing).
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'LarynxCancer', c('Drinking'),'interpolated')
```
