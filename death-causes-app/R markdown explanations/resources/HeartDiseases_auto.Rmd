Heart disease is a **death cause category**. It means that it is a collection of **death causes** and so we can compute the probability of dying from this death cause category by adding up all of its death causes. 

#### Alternative names:
* Heart dis.
* Heart disease
* HeartDiseases

#### Death causes

Heart disease consists of the following causes

* [Coronary heart disease](/model/Ischemic)
* [Other heart disease](/model/OtherHeartDiseases)
* [Stroke](/model/Stroke)

#### Categories

Heart disease is itself part of the following death cause categories

* [Non-violent death](/model/NonViolentDeath)

#### Risk factors

In the model Heart disease has the following [risk factors](/model/intro#risk-factor)

* [Greens consumption](/model/Greens) (Greens)


#### Interaction

The combined risk ratio of all risk factors is computed using the formula

$$
RR=RR_{\text{Greens}}
$$

The normalization factor is based on the joint distribution of all the risk factors and is computed using the formula

$$
P=P_{\text{Greens}}
$$

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::load_all('../../../Reportgeneration/DatabaseVisualization/RRtablePlotting')
dat=initialize_database(c("../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Causes.json",
"../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/CategoryCauses.json"),
"../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Descriptions.json")
```


#### Greens consumption

Greens consumption is a risk factor for Heart disease.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature alterated to fit our model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'HeartDiseases', c('Greens'),'raw')
```


Because the variable Greens consumption is numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing).
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'HeartDiseases', c('Greens'),'interpolated')
```
