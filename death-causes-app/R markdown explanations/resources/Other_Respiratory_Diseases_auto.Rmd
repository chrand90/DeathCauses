Other respiratory disease is a **death cause**. It means that there is a certain probability that one dies from this.

#### Alternative names:
* Other lungd.
* Other respi. dis.
* Other respiratory dis.
* Other respiratory disease
* Other_Respiratory_Diseases

#### Categories

Other respiratory disease is part of the following death cause categories

* [Respiratory disease](/model/RespiratoryDiseases)

#### Risk factors

Other respiratory disease has no [risk factors](/model/intro#risk-factor) in the model (yet).

#### Number of deaths

In 2014 Other respiratory disease was responsible for 1.42% of the deaths in the US. Below is a plot of how prevalent the death was for different ages [@CDCreport]

```


#### Definition

The definition of dying from Other respiratory disease is to get any of the following ICD codes as the main cause of death on one's death certificate. The percentage is the proportion of the deaths from Other respiratory disease who falls under the ICD code
