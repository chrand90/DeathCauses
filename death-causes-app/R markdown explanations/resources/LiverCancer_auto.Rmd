Liver cancer is a **death cause**. It means that there is a certain probability that one dies from this.

#### Alternative names:
* Liver cancer
* LiverCancer

#### Categories

Liver cancer is part of the following death cause categories

* [Cancer](/model/Cancer)

#### Risk factors

In the model Liver cancer has the following [risk factors](/model/intro#risk-factor)

* [HCV diagnosis](/model/HCVStatus) (HCV)
* [BMI](/model/BMI)
* [Coffee consumption](/model/Caffeine) (Coffee)
* [Diabetes diagnosis](/model/DiabetesStatus) (Diabetes)
* [Biological sex](/model/Sex) (Sex)
* [Alcohol consumption](/model/Drinking) (Alcohol)

#### Number of deaths

In 2014 Liver cancer was responsible for 0.941% of the deaths in the US. Below is a plot of how prevalent the death was for different ages [@CDCreport]
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::load_all('../../../Reportgeneration/DatabaseVisualization/RRtablePlotting')
dat=initialize_database(c("../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Causes.json"),
"../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Descriptions.json")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'LiverCancer')
```


#### Definition

The definition of dying from Liver cancer is to get any of the following ICD codes as the main cause of death on one's death certificate. The percentage is the proportion of the deaths from Liver cancer who falls under the ICD code 

* <details><summary> C22: Malignant neoplasm of liver and intrahepatic bile ducts (100.0%)</summary>
    * **C220: Liver cell carcinoma (38.9%)**
    * **C221: Intrahepatic bile duct carcinoma (23.5%)**
    * C222: Hepatoblastoma (0.089%)
    * C223: Angiosarcoma of liver (0.1%)
    * C224: Other sarcomas of liver (0.004%)
    * C227: Other specified carcinomas of liver (0.004%)
    * **C229: Malignant neoplasm of liver, not specified as primary or secondary (37.4%)**
</details>

#### Interaction

The combined risk ratio of all risk factors is computed using the formula

$$
RR=RR_{\text{BMI,HCV}} \cdot RR_{\text{Coffee}} \cdot RR_{\text{Diabetes}} \cdot RR_{\text{Alcohol,Sex}}
$$

The normalization factor is based on the joint distribution of all the risk factors and is computed using the formula

$$
P=P_{\text{HCV,BMI}} \cdot P_{\text{Coffee}} \cdot P_{\text{Diabetes}} \cdot P_{\text{Sex,Alcohol}}
$$


#### BMI, HCV diagnosis

BMI and HCV diagnosis are a group of risk factors for Liver cancer.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature alterated to fit our model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'LiverCancer', c('BMI','HCVStatus'),'raw')
```


Because the variable BMI is numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing)for every value of the other variables.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'LiverCancer', c('BMI','HCVStatus'),'interpolated')
```


#### Coffee consumption

Coffee consumption is a risk factor for Liver cancer.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature alterated to fit our model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'LiverCancer', c('Caffeine'),'raw')
```


Because the variable Coffee consumption is numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing).
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'LiverCancer', c('Caffeine'),'interpolated')
```


#### Diabetes diagnosis

Diabetes diagnosis is a risk factor for Liver cancer.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature alterated to fit our model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'LiverCancer', c('DiabetesStatus'),'raw')
```


#### Alcohol consumption, Biological sex

Alcohol consumption and Biological sex are a group of risk factors for Liver cancer.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature alterated to fit our model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'LiverCancer', c('Drinking','Sex'),'raw')
```


Because the variable Alcohol consumption is numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing)for every value of the other variables.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'LiverCancer', c('Drinking','Sex'),'interpolated')
```
