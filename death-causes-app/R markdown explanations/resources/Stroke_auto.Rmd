Stroke is a **death cause**. It means that there is a certain probability that one dies from this.

#### Categories

Stroke is part of the following death cause categories

* [Heart disease](/model/HeartDiseases)

#### Risk factors

In the model Stroke has the following [risk factors](/model/intro#risk-factor)

* [Total physical activity time](/model/PhysicalTotal) (Phys. total)
* [Current smoking amount](/model/SmokeIntensity) (Cigarettes)
* [Greens consumption](/model/Greens) (Greens) inherited from [Heart disease](/model/HeartDiseases)

#### Number of deaths

In 2014 Stroke was responsible for 5.07% of the deaths in the US. Below is a plot of how prevalent the death was for different ages [@CDCreport]

```

#### Definition

The definition of dying from Stroke is to get any of the following ICD codes as the main cause of death on one's death certificate. The percentage is the proportion of the deaths from Stroke who falls under the ICD code

#### Interaction

The combined risk ratio of all risk factors is computed using the [formula](/model/intro#interaction-formulas)

$$
RR=RR_{\text{Phys. total}} \cdot RR_{\text{Cigarettes}} \cdot RR_{\text{Greens}}
$$

The normalization factor is based on the joint distribution of all the risk factors and is computed using the [formula](/model/intro#interaction-formulas)

$$
P=P_{\text{Phys. total}} \cdot P_{\text{Cigarettes}} \cdot P_{\text{Greens}}
$$


#### Total physical activity time

[Total physical activity time](/model/PhysicalTotal) is a risk factor for Stroke.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature (possibly adjusted to fit the model)

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'Stroke', c('PhysicalTotal'),'raw')
```


Because the variable Total physical activity time is numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing).

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'Stroke', c('PhysicalTotal'),'interpolated')
```


#### Current smoking amount

[Current smoking amount](/model/SmokeIntensity) is a risk factor for Stroke.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature (possibly adjusted to fit the model)

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'Stroke', c('SmokeIntensity'),'raw')
```


Because the variable Current smoking amount is numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing).

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'Stroke', c('SmokeIntensity'),'interpolated')
```
