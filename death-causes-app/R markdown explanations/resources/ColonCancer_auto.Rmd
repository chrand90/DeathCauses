Colon cancer is a **death cause**. It means that there is a certain probability that one dies from this.

#### Alternative names:
* Colon cancer
* ColonCancer

#### Categories

Colon cancer is part of the following death cause categories

* [Cancer](/model/Cancer)

#### Risk factors

In the model Colon cancer has the following [risk factors](/model/intro#risk-factor)

* [Alcohol consumption](/model/Drinking) (Alcohol)
* [Total physical activity time](/model/PhysicalTotal) (Phys. total)
* [Red meat consumption](/model/RedMeat) (Red meat)

#### Number of deaths

In 2014 Colon cancer was responsible for 1.99% of the deaths in the US. Below is a plot of how prevalent the death was for different ages [@CDCreport]
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::load_all('../../../Reportgeneration/DatabaseVisualization/RRtablePlotting')
dat=initialize_database(c("../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Causes.json"),
"../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Descriptions.json")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'ColonCancer')
```


#### Definition

The definition of dying from Colon cancer is to get any of the following ICD codes as the main cause of death on one's death certificate. The percentage is the proportion of the deaths from Colon cancer who falls under the ICD code 

* <details><summary> C18: Malignant neoplasm of colon (79.5%)</summary>
    * C180: Malignant neoplasm of cecum (0.63%)
    * C181: Malignant neoplasm of appendix (1.4%)
    * C182: Malignant neoplasm of ascending colon (0.38%)
    * C183: Malignant neoplasm of hepatic flexure (0.011%)
    * C184: Malignant neoplasm of transverse colon (0.088%)
    * C185: Malignant neoplasm of splenic flexure (0.0057%)
    * C186: Malignant neoplasm of descending colon (0.052%)
    * C187: Malignant neoplasm of sigmoid colon (0.68%)
    * C188: Malignant neoplasm of overlapping sites of colon (0.0019%)
    * **C189: Malignant neoplasm of colon, unspecified (76.3%)**
</details>
* C19: Malignant neoplasm of rectosigmoid junction (5.7%)
* C20: Malignant neoplasm of rectum (13.0%)
* <details><summary> C21: Malignant neoplasm of anus and anal canal (1.8%)</summary>
    * C210: Malignant neoplasm of anus, unspecified (1.5%)
    * C211: Malignant neoplasm of anal canal (0.098%)
    * C218: 1 Malig neoplasm of ovrlp sites of rectum, anus and anal canal Malignant neoplasm of overlapping sites of rectum, anus and anal canal (0.17%)

#### Interaction

The combined risk ratio of all risk factors is computed using the formula

$$
RR=RR_{\text{Alcohol}} \cdot RR_{\text{Phys. total}} \cdot RR_{\text{Red meat}}
$$

The normalization factor is based on the joint distribution of all the risk factors and is computed using the formula

$$
P=P_{\text{Alcohol}} \cdot P_{\text{Phys. total}} \cdot P_{\text{Red meat}}
$$


#### Alcohol consumption

Alcohol consumption is a risk factor for Colon cancer.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature alterated to fit our model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'ColonCancer', c('Drinking'),'raw')
```


Because the variable Alcohol consumption is numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing).
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'ColonCancer', c('Drinking'),'interpolated')
```


#### Total physical activity time

Total physical activity time is a risk factor for Colon cancer.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature alterated to fit our model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'ColonCancer', c('PhysicalTotal'),'raw')
```


Because the variable Total physical activity time is numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing).
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'ColonCancer', c('PhysicalTotal'),'interpolated')
```


#### Red meat consumption

Red meat consumption is a risk factor for Colon cancer.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature alterated to fit our model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'ColonCancer', c('RedMeat'),'raw')
```


Because the variable Red meat consumption is numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing).
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'ColonCancer', c('RedMeat'),'interpolated')
```
