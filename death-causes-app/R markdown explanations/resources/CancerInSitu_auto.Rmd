Cancer in situ is a **death cause**. It means that there is a certain probability that one dies from this.

#### Alternative names:
* In situ ca.
* Cancer in situ
* CancerInSitu

#### Categories

Cancer in situ is part of the following death cause categories

* [Cancer](/model/Cancer)

#### Risk factors

Cancer in situ has no [risk factors](/model/intro#risk-factor) in the model (yet).

#### Number of deaths

In 2014 Cancer in situ was responsible for 0.611% of the deaths in the US. Below is a plot of how prevalent the death was for different ages [@CDCreport]

#### Definition

The definition of dying from Cancer in situ is to get any of the following ICD codes as the main cause of death on one's death certificate. The percentage is the proportion of the deaths from Cancer in situ who falls under the ICD code
