Lung cancer is a **death cause**. It means that there is a certain probability that one dies from this.

#### Alternative names:
* Lung cancer
* LungCancer

#### Categories

Lung cancer is part of the following death cause categories

* [Cancer](/model/Cancer)

#### Risk factors

In the model Lung cancer has the following [risk factors](/model/intro#risk-factor)

* [Time since smoking per year](/model/SmokeSinceStop) (Smoke end a.)
* [Smoking average](/model/SmokeTypicalAmount) (Smoke avg.)

#### Number of deaths

In 2014 Lung cancer was responsible for 5.92% of the deaths in the US. Below is a plot of how prevalent the death was for different ages [@CDCreport]
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::load_all('../../../Reportgeneration/DatabaseVisualization/RRtablePlotting')
dat=initialize_database(c("../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Causes.json"),
"../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Descriptions.json")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'LungCancer')
```


#### Definition

The definition of dying from Lung cancer is to get any of the following ICD codes as the main cause of death on one's death certificate. The percentage is the proportion of the deaths from Lung cancer who falls under the ICD code 

* C33: Malignant neoplasm of trachea (0.053%)
* <details><summary> C34: Malignant neoplasm of bronchus and lung (99.947%)</summary>
    * C340: Malignant neoplasm of main bronchus (0.029%)
    * C341: Malignant neoplasm of upper lobe, bronchus or lung (0.32%)
    * C342: Malignant neoplasm of middle lobe, bronchus or lung (0.024%)
    * C343: Malignant neoplasm of lower lobe, bronchus or lung (0.14%)
    * C348: 0 Malignant neoplasm of overlapping sites of bronchus and lung Malignant neoplasm of overlapping sites of bronchus and lung (0.0039%)
    * **C349: Malignant neoplasm of unspecified part of bronchus or lung (99.43%)**
</details>

#### Interaction

The combined risk ratio of all risk factors is computed using the formula

$$
RR=RR_{\text{Smoke avg.,Smoke end a.}}
$$

The normalization factor is based on the joint distribution of all the risk factors and is computed using the formula

$$
P=P_{\text{Smoke end a.,Smoke avg.}}
$$


#### Smoking average, Time since smoking per year

Smoking average and Time since smoking per year are a group of risk factors for Lung cancer.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature alterated to fit our model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'LungCancer', c('SmokeTypicalAmount','SmokeSinceStop'),'raw')
```


Because the variables Smoking average and Time since smoking per year are numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing).
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'LungCancer', c('SmokeTypicalAmount','SmokeSinceStop'),'interpolated')
```
