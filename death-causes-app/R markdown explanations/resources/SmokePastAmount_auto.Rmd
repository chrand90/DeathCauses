Amount smoked in the past is a **input factor**. It means that it is one of the inputs from the user to the model.

#### Alternative names:
* Smoking past
* Smoking amount(past)
* Amount smoked in the past
* SmokePastAmount

#### Uses

Amount smoked in the past is used by the model in the following places

* to compute [Total amount smoked in life](/model/SmokeCumulative)

#### Guidance

The user input is a typed number and should answer the question

> When you did smoke tobacco in the past, how much did you smoke in a normal day?

The unit of the input is **Cigarettes**.

The answer has to be larger than 0 Cigarettes.The answer is recommended to be larger than 0 Cigarettes and smaller than 40 Cigarettes, because that is where the model is most accurate.If you smoke tobacco in other forms than cigarettes, you should convert it to their equivalence in cigarettes. For example as a rule of thumb, one bowl of toccao in a pipe is equivalent to 2.5 cigarettes.
