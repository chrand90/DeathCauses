Emphysema is a **death cause**. It means that there is a certain probability that one dies from this.

#### Categories

Emphysema is part of the following death cause categories

* [Respiratory disease](/model/RespiratoryDiseases)

#### Risk factors

In the model Emphysema has the following [risk factors](/model/intro#risk-factor)

* [Current smoking amount](/model/SmokeIntensity) (Cigarettes)

#### Number of deaths

In 2014 Emphysema was responsible for 0.284% of the deaths in the US. Below is a plot of how prevalent the death was for different ages [@CDCreport]
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::load_all('../../../Reportgeneration/DatabaseVisualization/RRtablePlotting')
dat=initialize_database(c("../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Causes.json"),
"../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Descriptions.json")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'Emphysema')
```


#### Definition

The definition of dying from Emphysema is to get any of the following ICD codes as the main cause of death on one's death certificate. The percentage is the proportion of the deaths from Emphysema who falls under the ICD code 

* <details><summary> J43: Emphysema (100.0%)</summary>
    * J430: Unilateral pulmonary emphysema [MacLeod's syndrome] (0.013%)
    * J431: Panlobular emphysema (0.013%)
    * J432: Centrilobular emphysema (0.29%)
    * J438: Other emphysema (0.027%)
    * **J439: Emphysema, unspecified (99.65%)**
</details>

#### Interaction

The combined risk ratio of all risk factors is computed using the [formula](/model/intro#interaction-formulas)

$$
RR=RR_{\text{Cigarettes}}
$$

The normalization factor is based on the joint distribution of all the risk factors and is computed using the [formula](/model/intro#interaction-formulas)

$$
P=P_{\text{Cigarettes}}
$$


#### Current smoking amount

Current smoking amount is a risk factor for Emphysema.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature adjusted to fit the model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'Emphysema', c('SmokeIntensity'),'raw')
```


Because the variable Current smoking amount is numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing).

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'Emphysema', c('SmokeIntensity'),'interpolated')
```
