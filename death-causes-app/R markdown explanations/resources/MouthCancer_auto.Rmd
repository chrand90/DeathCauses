Mouth cancer is a **death cause**. It means that there is a certain probability that one dies from this.

#### Alternative names:
* Mouth ca.
* Mouth cancer
* MouthCancer

#### Categories

Mouth cancer is part of the following death cause categories

* [Cancer](/model/Cancer)

#### Risk factors

In the model Mouth cancer has the following [risk factors](/model/intro#risk-factor)

* [Alcohol consumption](/model/Drinking) (Alcohol)
* [Current smoking amount](/model/SmokeIntensity) (Cigarettes)

#### Number of deaths

In 2014 Mouth cancer was responsible for 0.358% of the deaths in the US. Below is a plot of how prevalent the death was for different ages [@CDCreport]

```

```


#### Definition

The definition of dying from Mouth cancer is to get any of the following ICD codes as the main cause of death on one's death certificate. The percentage is the proportion of the deaths from Mouth cancer who falls under the ICD code

#### Interaction

The combined risk ratio of all risk factors is computed using the [formula](/model/intro#interaction-formulas)

$$
RR=RR_{\text{Alcohol,Cigarettes}}
$$

The normalization factor is based on the joint distribution of all the risk factors and is computed using the [formula](/model/intro#interaction-formulas)

$$
P=P_{\text{Alcohol,Cigarettes}}
$$


#### Alcohol consumption, Current smoking amount

Alcohol consumption and Current smoking amount are a group of risk factors for Mouth cancer.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature (possibly adjusted to fit the model)

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'MouthCancer', c('Drinking','SmokeIntensity'),'raw')
```


Because the variables Alcohol consumption and Current smoking amount are numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing).

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'MouthCancer', c('Drinking','SmokeIntensity'),'interpolated')
```
