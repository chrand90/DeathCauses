#### Number of deaths

In 2014 Anemia was responsible for 0.198% of the deaths in the US. Below is a plot of how prevalent the death was for different ages [@CDCreport]
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::load_all('../../../Reportgeneration/DatabaseVisualization/RRtablePlotting')
dat=initialize_database(c("../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Causes.json"),
"../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Descriptions.json")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}

```


#### Definition

The definition of dying from Anemia is to get any of the following ICD codes as the main cause of death on one's death certificate. The percentage is the proportion of the deaths from Anemia who falls under the ICD code
