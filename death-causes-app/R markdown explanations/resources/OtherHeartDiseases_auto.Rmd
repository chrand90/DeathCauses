Other heart disease is a **death cause**. It means that there is a certain probability that one dies from this.

#### Alternative names:
* Other heartd.
* Other heart disease
* OtherHeartDiseases

#### Categories

Other heart disease is part of the following death cause categories

* [Heart disease](/model/HeartDiseases)

#### Risk factors

In the model Other heart disease has the following [risk factors](/model/intro#risk-factor)

* [Greens consumption](/model/Greens) (Greens) inherited from [Heart disease](/model/HeartDiseases)

#### Number of deaths

In 2014 Other heart disease was responsible for 11.8% of the deaths in the US. Below is a plot of how prevalent the death was for different ages [@CDCreport]

#### Definition

The definition of dying from Other heart disease is to get any of the following ICD codes as the main cause of death on one's death certificate. The percentage is the proportion of the deaths from Other heart disease who falls under the ICD code
