Childbirth is a **death cause**. It means that there is a certain probability that one dies from this.

#### Categories

Childbirth is part of the following death cause categories

* [Non-violent death](/model/NonViolentDeath)

#### Risk factors

In the model Childbirth has the following [risk factors](/model/intro#risk-factor)

* [Biological sex](/model/Sex) (Sex)

#### Number of deaths

In 2014 Childbirth was responsible for 0.043% of the deaths in the US. Below is a plot of how prevalent the death was for different ages [@CDCreport]

#### Definition

The definition of dying from Childbirth is to get any of the following ICD codes as the main cause of death on one's death certificate. The percentage is the proportion of the deaths from Childbirth who falls under the ICD code

#### Interaction

The combined risk ratio of all risk factors is computed using the formula

$$
RR=RR_{\text{Sex}}
$$

The normalization factor is based on the joint distribution of all the risk factors and is computed using the formula

$$
P=P_{\text{Sex}}
$$


#### Biological sex

Biological sex is a risk factor for Childbirth.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature alterated to fit our model
