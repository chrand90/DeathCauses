Average amount smoked in smoking period is a **computed factor**. It means that it can be determined with total certainty from the user input.

#### Alternative names:
* Smoke avg.
* Smoking average
* Average amount smoked in smoking period
* SmokeTypicalAmount

#### Input

Average amount smoked in smoking period is computed with the following factors

* [Smoking status](/model/Smoking)
* [Amount smoked in the past](/model/SmokePastAmount)
* [Time span of smoking period](/model/SmokeDuration)
* [Current smoking amount](/model/SmokeIntensity)
* [Time since you stopped smoking](/model/SmokingStopped)

#### Uses

Average amount smoked in smoking period is used by the model in the following places

* as a risk factor for [Bladder cancer](/model/BladderCancer)
* as a risk factor for [Lung cancer](/model/LungCancer)
* as a risk factor for [Coronary heart disease](/model/Ischemic)
* as a risk factor for [COPD](/model/COPD)


### Optimizability

[Optimizability](/model/optimizabilities) is a subjective measure used to describe how easy it is to optimize a certain factor of your life. The optimizability of Average amount smoked in smoking period is [3](/model/optimizabilities#category-3)(unless [Smoking status](/model/Smoking)='Current smoker' in which case the optimizability is [5](/model/optimizabilities#category-5)).


### Computation

If one's [Smoking status](/model/Smoking) is 'Current smoker' this factor is equal to [Current smoking amount](/model/SmokeIntensity). If one is a 'Former smoker', it is equal to how much one smoked in the past. That is [Past smoking amount](/model/SmokePastAmount). If one is a 'never smoker', it is equal to 0. 

If the user has changed the advanced settings such that the [computation period](/model/advancedOptions#computation-period) starts before he or she began smoking, this factor will be 0. This is why computation of Average smoking also uses [Time since smoking](/model/SmokingStopped) and [Time span of smoking period](/model/SmokeDuration). 

This factor potentially changes over time (because one can set the start of the computation period before start of smoking), so we compute a value for every year.
