Cervix cancer is a **death cause**. It means that there is a certain probability that one dies from this.

#### Alternative names:
* Cervix ca.
* Cervix cancer
* CervixCancer

#### Categories

Cervix cancer is part of the following death cause categories

* [Cancer](/model/Cancer)

#### Risk factors

In the model Cervix cancer has the following [risk factors](/model/intro#risk-factor)

* [HPV vaccine](/model/HPVVaccine)
* [Biological sex](/model/Sex) (Sex)

#### Number of deaths

In 2014 Cervix cancer was responsible for 0.157% of the deaths in the US. Below is a plot of how prevalent the death was for different ages [@CDCreport]
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::load_all('../../../Reportgeneration/DatabaseVisualization/RRtablePlotting')
dat=initialize_database(c("../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Causes.json"),
"../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Descriptions.json")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'CervixCancer')
```


#### Definition

The definition of dying from Cervix cancer is to get any of the following ICD codes as the main cause of death on one's death certificate. The percentage is the proportion of the deaths from Cervix cancer who falls under the ICD code 

* <details><summary> C53: Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri (100.0%)</summary>
    * C530: Malignant neoplasm of endocervix (0.7%)
    * C539: Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri, unspecified (99.3%)
</details>

#### Interaction

The combined risk ratio of all risk factors is computed using the [formula](/model/intro#interaction-formulas)

$$
RR=RR_{\text{HPV vaccine}} \cdot RR_{\text{Sex}}
$$

The normalization factor is based on the joint distribution of all the risk factors and is computed using the [formula](/model/intro#interaction-formulas)

$$
P=P_{\text{HPV vaccine}} \cdot P_{\text{Sex}}
$$


#### HPV vaccine

[HPV vaccine](/model/HPVVaccine) is a risk factor for Cervix cancer.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature (possibly adjusted to fit the model)

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'CervixCancer', c('HPVVaccine'),'raw')
```


#### Biological sex

[Biological sex](/model/Sex) is a risk factor for Cervix cancer.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature (possibly adjusted to fit the model)

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'CervixCancer', c('Sex'),'raw')
```
