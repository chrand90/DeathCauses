Suicide is a **death cause**. It means that there is a certain probability that one dies from this.

#### Categories

Suicide is part of the following death cause categories

* [Violent death](/model/ViolentDeath)

#### Risk factors

In the model Suicide has the following [risk factors](/model/intro#risk-factor)

* [Depression](/model/Depression)

#### Number of deaths

In 2014 Suicide was responsible for 1.63% of the deaths in the US. Below is a plot of how prevalent the death was for different ages [@CDCreport]

devtools::load_all('../../../Reportgeneration/DatabaseVisualization/RRtablePlotting')

```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'Suicide')
```


#### Definition

The definition of dying from Suicide is to get any of the following ICD codes as the main cause of death on one's death certificate. The percentage is the proportion of the deaths from Suicide who falls under the ICD code

#### Interaction

The combined risk ratio of all risk factors is computed using the [formula](/model/intro#interaction-formulas)

$$
RR=RR_{\text{Depression}}
$$

The normalization factor is based on the joint distribution of all the risk factors and is computed using the [formula](/model/intro#interaction-formulas)

$$
P=P_{\text{Depression}}
$$


#### Depression

Depression is a risk factor for Suicide.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature adjusted to fit the model
