Esophagus cancer is a **death cause**. It means that there is a certain probability that one dies from this.

#### Alternative names:
* Esophagus ca.
* Esophagus cancer
* EatingTubeCancer

#### Categories

Esophagus cancer is part of the following death cause categories

* [Cancer](/model/Cancer)

#### Risk factors

In the model Esophagus cancer has the following [risk factors](/model/intro#risk-factor)

* [Alcohol consumption](/model/Drinking) (Alcohol)

#### Number of deaths

In 2014 Esophagus cancer was responsible for 0.569% of the deaths in the US. Below is a plot of how prevalent the death was for different ages [@CDCreport]
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::load_all('../../../Reportgeneration/DatabaseVisualization/RRtablePlotting')
dat=initialize_database(c("../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Causes.json"),
"../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Descriptions.json")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'EatingTubeCancer')
```


#### Definition

The definition of dying from Esophagus cancer is to get any of the following ICD codes as the main cause of death on one's death certificate. The percentage is the proportion of the deaths from Esophagus cancer who falls under the ICD code 

* <details><summary> C15: Malignant neoplasm of esophagus (100.0%)</summary>
    * C150 (0.067%)
    * C151 (0.027%)
    * C152 (0.013%)
    * C153: Malignant neoplasm of upper third of esophagus (0.027%)
    * C154: Malignant neoplasm of middle third of esophagus (0.013%)
    * C155: Malignant neoplasm of lower third of esophagus (0.49%)
    * C158: Malignant neoplasm of overlapping sites of esophagus (0.013%)
    * **C159: Malignant neoplasm of esophagus, unspecified (99.34%)**
</details>

#### Interaction

The combined risk ratio of all risk factors is computed using the [formula](/model/intro#interaction-formulas)

$$
RR=RR_{\text{Alcohol}}
$$

The normalization factor is based on the joint distribution of all the risk factors and is computed using the [formula](/model/intro#interaction-formulas)

$$
P=P_{\text{Alcohol}}
$$


#### Alcohol consumption

[Alcohol consumption](/model/Drinking) is a risk factor for Esophagus cancer.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature (possibly adjusted to fit the model)

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'EatingTubeCancer', c('Drinking'),'raw')
```


Because the variable Alcohol consumption is numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing).

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'EatingTubeCancer', c('Drinking'),'interpolated')
```
