Hepatitis is a **death cause**. It means that there is a certain probability that one dies from this.

#### Categories

Hepatitis is part of the following death cause categories

* [Infectious disease](/model/InfectiousDisease)

#### Risk factors

In the model Hepatitis has the following [risk factors](/model/intro#risk-factor)

* [HCV diagnosis](/model/HCVStatus) (HCV)

#### Number of deaths

In 2014 Hepatitis was responsible for 0.308% of the deaths in the US. Below is a plot of how prevalent the death was for different ages [@CDCreport]
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::load_all('../../../Reportgeneration/DatabaseVisualization/RRtablePlotting')
dat=initialize_database(c("../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Causes.json"),
"../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Descriptions.json")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'Hepatitis')
```


#### Definition

The definition of dying from Hepatitis is to get any of the following ICD codes as the main cause of death on one's death certificate. The percentage is the proportion of the deaths from Hepatitis who falls under the ICD code 

* <details><summary> B1 (100.0%)</summary>
    * B15: Acute hepatitis A (0.32%)
        * B150: Hepatitis A with hepatic coma (0.012%)
        * B159: Hepatitis A without hepatic coma (0.31%)
    * B16: Acute hepatitis B (5.1%)
        * B162: Acute hepatitis B without delta-agent with hepatic coma (0.2%)
        * B169: Acute hepatitis B without delta-agent and without hepatic coma (4.9%)
    * B17: Other acute viral hepatitis (1.4%)
        * B171: Acute hepatitis C (0.049%)
        * B172: Acute hepatitis E (0.037%)
        * B178: Other specified acute viral hepatitis (0.025%)
        * B179: Acute viral hepatitis, unspecified (1.3%)
    * **B18: Chronic viral hepatitis (92.5%)**
        * B181: Chronic viral hepatitis B without delta-agent (1.5%)
        * B182: Chronic viral hepatitis C (90.9%)
        * B188: Other chronic viral hepatitis (0.012%)
        * B189: Chronic viral hepatitis, unspecified (0.12%)
    * B19: Unspecified viral hepatitis (0.67%)
        * B190: Unspecified viral hepatitis with hepatic coma (0.012%)
        * B199: Unspecified viral hepatitis without hepatic coma (0.65%)

#### Interaction

The combined risk ratio of all risk factors is computed using the formula

$$
RR=RR_{\text{HCV}}
$$

The normalization factor is based on the joint distribution of all the risk factors and is computed using the formula

$$
P=P_{\text{HCV}}
$$


#### HCV diagnosis

HCV diagnosis is a risk factor for Hepatitis.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature alterated to fit our model
