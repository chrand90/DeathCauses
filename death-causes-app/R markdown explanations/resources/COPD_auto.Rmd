Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a **death cause**. It means that there is a certain probability that one dies from this.

#### Alternative names:
* COPD
* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

#### Categories

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is part of the following death cause categories

* [Respiratory disease](/model/RespiratoryDiseases)

#### Risk factors

In the model Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has the following [risk factors](/model/intro#risk-factor)

* [Time since smoking per year](/model/SmokeSinceStop) (Smoke end a.)
* [Smoking average](/model/SmokeTypicalAmount) (Smoke avg.)

#### Number of deaths

In 2014 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was responsible for 5.15% of the deaths in the US. Below is a plot of how prevalent the death was for different ages [@CDCreport]

library(devtools)
devtools::load_all('../../../Reportgeneration/DatabaseVisualization/RRtablePlotting')
dat=initialize_database(c("../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Causes.json"),
"../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Descriptions.json")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'COPD')
```


#### Definition

The definition of dying from Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is to get any of the following ICD codes as the main cause of death on one's death certificate. The percentage is the proportion of the deaths from Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who falls under the ICD code 

* <details><summary> J44: Other chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (99.28%)</summary>
    * J440: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute lower respiratory infection (14.9%)
    * J441: 1 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease w (acute) exacerbation Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with (acute) exacerbation (3.8%)
    * J448 (1.1%)
    * J449: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified (79.6%)
</details>
* J47: Bronchiectasis (0.72%)

#### Interaction

The combined risk ratio of all risk factors is computed using the [formula](/model/intro#interaction-formulas)

$$
RR=RR_{\text{Smoke avg.,Smoke end a.}}
$$

The normalization factor is based on the joint distribution of all the risk factors and is computed using the [formula](/model/intro#interaction-formulas)

$$
P=P_{\text{Smoke end a.,Smoke avg.}}
$$


#### Smoking average, Time since smoking per year

Smoking average and Time since smoking per year are a group of risk factors for Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature adjusted to fit the model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'COPD', c('SmokeTypicalAmount','SmokeSinceStop'),'raw')
```


Because the variables Smoking average and Time since smoking per year are numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing).

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'COPD', c('SmokeTypicalAmount','SmokeSinceStop'),'interpolated')
```
