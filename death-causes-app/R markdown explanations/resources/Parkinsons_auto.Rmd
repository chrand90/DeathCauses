Parkinsons is a **death cause**. It means that there is a certain probability that one dies from this.

#### Categories

Parkinsons is part of the following death cause categories

* [Non-violent death](/model/NonViolentDeath)

#### Risk factors

In the model Parkinsons has the following [risk factors](/model/intro#risk-factor)

* [Coffee consumption](/model/Caffeine) (Coffee)
* [Family history parkinsons](/model/FamilyHistoryParkinson) (Family Park.)
* [Pesticide exposure](/model/PesticideExposure) (Pesticides)

#### Number of deaths

In 2014 Parkinsons was responsible for 0.994% of the deaths in the US. Below is a plot of how prevalent the death was for different ages [@CDCreport]
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::load_all('../../../Reportgeneration/DatabaseVisualization/RRtablePlotting')
dat=initialize_database(c("../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Causes.json"),
"../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Descriptions.json")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'Parkinsons')
```


#### Definition

The definition of dying from Parkinsons is to get any of the following ICD codes as the main cause of death on one's death certificate. The percentage is the proportion of the deaths from Parkinsons who falls under the ICD code 

* G20: Parkinson's disease (99.0%)
* <details><summary> G21: Secondary parkinsonism (0.68%)</summary>
    * G210: Malignant neuroleptic syndrome (0.24%)
    * G211: Other drug-induced secondary parkinsonism (0.011%)
    * G213: Postencephalitic parkinsonism (0.0038%)
    * G214: Vascular parkinsonism (0.046%)
    * G218: Other secondary parkinsonism (0.011%)
    * G219: Secondary parkinsonism, unspecified (0.37%)
</details>

#### Interaction

The combined risk ratio of all risk factors is computed using the formula

$$
RR=RR_{\text{Coffee}} \cdot RR_{\text{Family Park.}} \cdot RR_{\text{Pesticides}}
$$

The normalization factor is based on the joint distribution of all the risk factors and is computed using the formula

$$
P=P_{\text{Coffee}} \cdot P_{\text{Family Park.}} \cdot P_{\text{Pesticides}}
$$


#### Coffee consumption

Coffee consumption is a risk factor for Parkinsons.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature alterated to fit our model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'Parkinsons', c('Caffeine'),'raw')
```


Because the variable Coffee consumption is numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing).
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'Parkinsons', c('Caffeine'),'interpolated')
```


#### Family history parkinsons

Family history parkinsons is a risk factor for Parkinsons.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature alterated to fit our model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'Parkinsons', c('FamilyHistoryParkinson'),'raw')
```


#### Pesticide exposure

Pesticide exposure is a risk factor for Parkinsons.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature alterated to fit our model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'Parkinsons', c('PesticideExposure'),'raw')
```


Because the variable Pesticide exposure is numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing).
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'Parkinsons', c('PesticideExposure'),'interpolated')
```
