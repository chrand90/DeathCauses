Breast cancer is a **death cause**. It means that there is a certain probability that one dies from this.

#### Alternative names:
* Breast ca.
* Breast cancer
* BreastCancer

#### Categories

Breast cancer is part of the following death cause categories

* [Cancer](/model/Cancer)

#### Risk factors

In the model Breast cancer has the following [risk factors](/model/intro#risk-factor)

* [Alcohol consumption](/model/Drinking) (Alcohol)
* [Ever used oral contraceptives](/model/OralContraceptiveEver) (OCP ever)
* [Biological sex](/model/Sex) (Sex)
* [Time since taking OCP per year](/model/OralContraceptiveSinceStop) (OCP end a.)

#### Number of deaths

In 2014 Breast cancer was responsible for 1.59% of the deaths in the US. Below is a plot of how prevalent the death was for different ages [@CDCreport]
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::load_all('../../../Reportgeneration/DatabaseVisualization/RRtablePlotting')
dat=initialize_database(c("../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Causes.json"),
"../../../death-causes-app/src/resources/Descriptions.json")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'BreastCancer')
```


#### Definition

The definition of dying from Breast cancer is to get any of the following ICD codes as the main cause of death on one's death certificate. The percentage is the proportion of the deaths from Breast cancer who falls under the ICD code 

* <details><summary> C50: Malignant neoplasm of breast (100.0%)</summary>
    * C500: Malignant neoplasm of nipple and areola (0.024%)
    * C501: Malignant neoplasm of central portion of breast (0.0024%)
    * C503: Malignant neoplasm of lower-inner quadrant of breast (0.0024%)
    * C506: Malignant neoplasm of axillary tail of breast (0.0024%)
    * **C509: Malignant neoplasm of breast of unspecified site (100.0%)**
</details>

#### Interaction

The combined risk ratio of all risk factors is computed using the formula

$$
RR=RR_{\text{Alcohol}} \cdot RR_{\text{OCP ever,OCP end a.}} \cdot RR_{\text{Sex}}
$$

The normalization factor is based on the joint distribution of all the risk factors and is computed using the formula

$$
P=P_{\text{Alcohol}} \cdot P_{\text{OCP ever,Sex,OCP end a.}}
$$


#### Alcohol consumption

Alcohol consumption is a risk factor for Breast cancer.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature alterated to fit our model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'BreastCancer', c('Drinking'),'raw')
```


Because the variable Alcohol consumption is numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing).
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'BreastCancer', c('Drinking'),'interpolated')
```


#### Ever used oral contraceptives, Time since taking OCP per year

Ever used oral contraceptives and Time since taking OCP per year are a group of risk factors for Breast cancer.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature alterated to fit our model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'BreastCancer', c('OralContraceptiveEver','OralContraceptiveSinceStop'),'raw')
```


Because the variable Time since taking OCP per year is numeric, we have computed a [smoothed approximation](/model/intro#smoothing)for every value of the other variables.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'BreastCancer', c('OralContraceptiveEver','OralContraceptiveSinceStop'),'interpolated')
```


#### Biological sex

Biological sex is a risk factor for Breast cancer.

Below is a plot of the risk ratios we have taken from the literature alterated to fit our model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
plotSpecificPlots(dat, 'BreastCancer', c('Sex'),'raw')
```
