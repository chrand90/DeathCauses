We use the [meta analysis](#meta-analysis) of cohort studies by @hackshaw2018low to get age-specific risk ratios for different amounts of smoking. They computed a joint [risk ratio](#risk-ratio) using estimates that were adjusted for different other [risk factors](#risk-factors). Only age was a common adjusting risk factor in all the studies. The meta analysis focused on low-intensity smokers which means that they estimated the risk ratio when smoking just one cigarette per day and this is great because it seems that even a little smoking is harmful to the heart. To take into account smoking cessation we multiplied the numbers from @hackshaw2018low with the smoking cessation estimates from @shields2013smoking. @shields2013smoking perfectly quantifies the drop in risk ratio of dying from coronary heart disease as more times passes since one stopped smoking, but unfortunately, they have not stratified on amount smoked, but instead put all former smokers in the same category. For us to obtain pseudo-stratified data we do the following. Let

$$
RR_{s,a,t}=RR(\text{smoke amount=s, age=a, time since smoking=t})\\
RR_{s,a,\bullet}=RR(\text{smoke amount=s, age=a})\\
RR^*=RR(\text{smoke amount=0, age=a})=1\\
RR_{\bullet,\bullet,t}=RR(\text{time since smoking=t})\\
\widetilde{RR}_t=RR_{\bullet,\bullet,t}/RR_{\bullet, \bullet,0}\\
\widetilde{RR}_{\infty}=RR(\text{never smoked})
$$
where all RR-risk ratios are with respect to never-smokers and the $\widetilde{RR}$-risk ratios are with respect to current smokers. The study by @hackslaw2018low contains the values $RR_{s,a,\bullet}$ and the study by @shields2013smoking provides $\widetilde{RR}_t$ and $\widetilde{RR}_{\infty}$. Ideally we would We estimate $RR_{s,a,t}$ by

$$
RR_{s,a,t}=RR^*+(RR_{s,a, \bullet}-RR^*)\cdot \frac{\widetilde{RR}_t-\widetilde{RR}_{\infty}}{\widetilde{RR}_0-\widetilde{RR}_{\infty}}
$$

The idea is as follows; as you stop smoking you slowly move from the risk ratio you would have if you still smoked ($RR_{s,a,\bullet}$) and towards the risk ratio applicable if you never smoked ($RR^*$). However, because the deathcauses framework works best if there are not 3-dimensional tables, we do not combine this to make an actual 3-dimensional table. Instead we keep two tables make the computation 

$$
RR_{s,a,t}=\Bigl\{\frac{RR_{s,a, \bullet}}{RR_{s,65,\bullet}}\Bigr\}\cdot \Bigl\{RR^*+(RR_{s,65,\bullet}-RR^*)\cdot \frac{\widetilde{RR}_t-\widetilde{RR}_{\infty}}{\widetilde{RR}_0-\widetilde{RR}_{\infty}}\Bigr\}
$$
where the first product term is saved in one table and the second product term is saved in another.The price for making this trick was to introduce an artificial standard age - here 65. In practice this means that young former smokers will still receive the age penalty $\frac{RR_{s,a, \bullet}}{RR_{s,65,\bullet}}$ even though they haven't smoked in a while.

The raw age penalties ($\frac{RR_{s,a, \bullet}}{RR_{s,65,\bullet}}$) are shown below. Be aware that this table only says how much more dangerous it is to smoke when you are young and not how dangerous it is to smoke when you are old.
