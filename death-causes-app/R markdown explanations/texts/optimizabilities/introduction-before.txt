Every risk factor is assigned an *optimizability* that describes how easy the factor is to optimize. For example, it is impossible to change your [biological sex](/model/Sex), but it is possible to change your [alcohol intake](/model/Drinking). Therefore we have given drinking habits a higher optmizability than the biological sex.

The optimizabilities are used to [decompose](/model/intro#decomposition) the risk of dying from a disease into smaller parts representing the responsibility of each risk factor. If some factors have the same optimizability, we use [another method](/model/intro#decomposing-two-equally-optimizable-factors).
