Alcohol consumption is a known risk factor for colon cancer. We use the [meta analysis](#meta-analysis) of cohort studies by @cho2004alcohol. They computed a joint [risk ratio](#risk-ratio) that were adjusted for many other [factors](#risk-factors), including physical activity and red meat consumed. This study is also ideal because it is a big meta analysis with data divided into many bins. They found that it was slightly better to drink a little($\text{RR}=0.94$) rather than nothing($\text{RR}=1.0$), but they thought it was an artifact of many former heavy drinkers who turned to abstinence. We therefore raise the risk ratio of the light drinkers to 1.0 as well.
