Smoking for a longer period is worse than smoking the same amount of cigarettes in a shorter time span [@baris2009case]. We use the numbers from @pitard2001cigar to estimate the effect of duartion of smoking. We prefer this study because it has good categories and because they report joint estimates with the amount of cigarettes smoked. 

Assessing the effect of Smoking cessation has not been the focus of much literature. We did however find a reference to a paper by @BURGER2013234 hidden behind a paywall. The referencing paper was @saginala2020epidemiology and they reported

> "However, smoking cessation has been shown to reduce the risk of bladder cancer by approximately 40% within only 1-4 years, and complete return to baseline risk by 20 years, suggesting a non-linear relationship between incidence and pack-years"

To use this information we expand with the assumptions

* If smoking cessation happened between 4 and 20 years ago, the risk increase from smoking duration is reduced by 70%
* If smoking cessation happened between 0 and 1 years ago, the risk increase from smoking duration is reduced by 0%

This leads to the risk ratios below.
