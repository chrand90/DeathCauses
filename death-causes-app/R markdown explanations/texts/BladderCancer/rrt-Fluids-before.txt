Higher fluid intake decreases the risk of bladder cancer. We use the numbers from @michaud1999fluid who found a significant dose-response relationship. Interestingly, when the analysis was conducted separately for each type of fluid, only water was significant. However, we will not use this fact, because the other beverages may be equally beneficial, which would also make sense if the authors' argumentation,  "fluid intake is good because it increases urination and thereby bladder cancer risk", is correct.
